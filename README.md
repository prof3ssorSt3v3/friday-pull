# friday-pull

demo for experimentation

First message in the Friday-pull repo.

Now it is your turn.

- clone this repo
- create a new branch with your name `git checkout -b [your name]`
- add a Markdown file with your name
- add a note inside that file
- `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` your new branch back to the repo.
- Got to the repo and create a pull request asking to merge your branch into `main`.

After you have done that, try to repeat the process with your partner for the React-NextJS assignment.

- Each of you create a repo with a Readme.md file.
- Invite the other person to collaborate.
- Clone your partner's repo.
- Create a new branch.
- Make a change in the new branch.
- Add, commit, and push your new branch to your partner's repo.
- Create a pull request on Github to merge your branch into `main`.
- Go back to your own repo and approve the merge.
