demo for experimentation

First message in the Friday-pull repo.

Now it is your turn.

- clone this repo
- create a new branch with your name `git branch -b [your name]`
- add a Markdown file with your name
- add a note inside that file
- `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` your new branch back to the repo.
- Got to the repo and create a pull request asking to merge your branch into `main`.
